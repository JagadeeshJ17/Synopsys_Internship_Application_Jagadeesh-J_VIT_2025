# Synopsys_Internship_Application_Jagadeesh-J_VIT_2025
## Why I’m a Good Fit
I'm a B.Tech Graduate (2025) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, with a strong foundation in **digital design, RTL design, digital verification and FPGA-based system design**.  
I am eager to contribute to Synopsys’s R&D efforts and further develop my skills in a challenging, innovation-driven environment.

## Key Highlights
- **Languages & Methodologies:** Proficient in Verilog, SystemVerilog, and UVM (Learning).
- **IEEE-Published Project:** Developed an optimized image smoothing system on FPGA, analyzing the impact of approximate and parallel prefix adders for improved convolution performance.  
  [DOI: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10940580]
- **Internship – Silicic Innova Technologies:** Gained exposure to real-time image processing on FPGA, explored communication protocols (APB, I2C, UART), and worked hands-on with Altera DE2-70 and Xilinx Artix-7 board.

- **Academic Elective – FPGA-Based System Design:** Scored S grade (10/10) at VIT Chennai; covered high-performance arithmetic circuits, FSM design, and optimization techniques for speed, area, and power.
