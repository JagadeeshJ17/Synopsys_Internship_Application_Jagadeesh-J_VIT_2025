## Why I’m a Good Fit
I am a final-year B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering student from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai (2025 batch), with a strong foundation in **digital design, RTL development, verification, and FPGA-based systems**.  
I am eager to contribute to Synopsys’s R&D efforts and further develop my skills in a challenging, innovation-driven environment.
