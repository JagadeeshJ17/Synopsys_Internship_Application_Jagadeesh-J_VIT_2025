# Synopsys_Internship_Application_Jagadeesh-J_VIT_2025
## Why I’m a Good Fit
I'm a B.Tech Graduate (2025) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, with a strong foundation in **digital design, RTL design, digital verification and FPGA-based system design**.  
I am eager to contribute to Synopsys’s R&D efforts and further develop my skills in a challenging, innovation-driven environment.

## Key Highlights
- **Languages & Methodologies:** Proficient in Verilog, SystemVerilog, and UVM (Learning).
- **IEEE-Published Project:** Developed an optimized image smoothing system on FPGA, analyzing the impact of approximate and parallel prefix adders for improved convolution performance.  
  [DOI: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10940580]
- **Internship – Silicic Innova Technologies:** Gained exposure to real-time image processing on FPGA, explored communication protocols (APB, I2C, UART), and worked hands-on with Altera DE2-70 and Xilinx Artix-7 board.
- **Academic Elective – FPGA-Based System Design:** Scored an S grade (10/10) at VIT Chennai. This course enhanced my understanding of high-performance arithmetic circuits, FSM design, and optimization techniques for speed, area, and power. I also gained hands-on experience in Quartus Prime and Altera DE2-115.

## Tools & Platforms
- **HDL/HVL:** Verilog, SystemVerilog, UVM (Learning)
- **EDA Tools:** ModelSim, Vivado, Quartus Prime, Cadence Virtuoso
- **FPGA Boards:** Altera DE2-70, DE2-115, Xilinx Artix-7, Zynq-7000
- **Protocols:** I2C, UART, SPI & APB 
- **OS:** Linux (basic commands)
